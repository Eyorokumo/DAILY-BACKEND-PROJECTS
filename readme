# # Todo List App

# A simple browser-based todo list application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# ## Features

# - Add new tasks with title, due date, and description
# - Edit existing tasks
# - Delete tasks
# - Tasks are saved in your browser (localStorage) and persist after refresh

# ## Usage

# 1. Click **Add new task** to open the modal form.
# 2. Fill in the task details and click **Add**.
# 3. Edit or delete tasks using the icons next to each task.
# 4. All changes are saved automatically.

# ## Project Structure

# ```
# ├── index.html
# ├── style.css
# ├── index.js
# ```

# ## How It Works

# - All tasks are stored in `localStorage` under the key `tasksData`.
# - On page load, tasks are loaded and displayed.
# - Editing a task removes it and lets you update its details.
# - Deleting a task removes it from the list and storage.
